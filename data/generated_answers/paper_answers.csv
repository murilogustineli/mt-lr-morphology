The varying degrees of morphological complexity in languages, such as isolating, fusional, agglutinative, and polysynthetic typologies, present significant challenges to machine translation systems, particularly in low-resource language contexts. For instance, fusional languages like Maltese exhibit intricate inflectional paradigms where a single morpheme can convey multiple grammatical features, complicating the disambiguation process in translation. Agglutinative languages, characterized by their concatenative morphology, may lead to extensive morphological variations that require comprehensive lexicons and robust morphological analyzers to ensure accurate translations. Polysynthetic languages, with their capacity to form complex words through the combination of numerous morphemes, pose additional difficulties in segmenting and translating these constructs into target languages. The scarcity of annotated corpora and linguistic resources for low-resource languages exacerbates these challenges, as machine translation systems often rely on large datasets for training and evaluation.","2. To address the challenges posed by morphological complexity, various techniques have been proposed, including rule-based methods, statistical models, and neural architectures. Rule-based approaches, such as the development of morphological analyzers like the one for Maltese, utilize finite-state transducers to model morphological rules and generate inflected forms. Statistical models leverage large corpora to learn probabilistic mappings between source and target languages, although they may struggle with the intricacies of morphology. More recently, neural architectures, particularly those employing subword modeling techniques, have gained traction, allowing for the decomposition of words into smaller units, thereby facilitating the handling of morphological variations and improving translation quality in low-resource contexts.","3. Morphology-aware techniques, such as subword modeling and morphological analyzers, demonstrate varying effectiveness in low-resource machine translation.
