"""low resource languages"" usually refers to languages that lack corpora and basic tools such as part of speech taggers. but a significant number of such languages do benefit from the availability of relatively complex linguistic descriptions of phonology, morphology, and syntax, as well as dictionaries. a further category, probably the majority of the worlds languages, suffers from the lack of even these resources. in this paper, we investigate the possibility of learning the morphology of such a language by relying on its close relationship to a language with more resources. specifically, we use a transfer based approach to learn the morphology of the severely under resourced language gofa, starting with a neural morphological generator for the closely related language, wolaytta. both languages are members of the omotic family, spoken and southwestern ethiopia, and, like other omotic languages, both are morphologically complex. we first create a finite state transducer for morphological analysis and generation for wolaytta, based on relatively complete linguistic descriptions and lexicons for the language. next, we train an encoder decoder neural network on the task of morphological generation for wolaytta, using data generated by the fst. such a network takes a root and a set of grammatical features as input and generates a word form as output. we then elicit gofa translations of a small set of wolaytta words from bilingual speakers. finally, we retrain the decoder of the wolaytta network, using a small set of gofa target words that are translations of the wolaytta outputs of the original network. the evaluation shows that the transfer network performs better than a separate encoder decoder network trained on a larger set of gofa words. we conclude with implications for the learning of morphology for severely under resourced languages in regions where there are related languages with more resources.","1.

"the fast growth of communication technology has brought nations and their cultures closer together, and the demand for cross language communication has risen tremendously. there is a different learning method to connect the source language to the target language in which unsupervised learning is a blessing for low resource languages. the unsupervised machine translation is always problematic to those languages which are morphologically rich and low resources languages. morphologically rich and low resource language does not provide good results in machine translation if the translation is from morphologically less complex language to morphologically more complex languages. in this paper, we have improved the unsupervised neural machine translation by tackling the ambiguity problem and the quality of pseudo parallel sentence pairs generated through back translation for morphologically rich languages. the ambiguity problem is solved by taking the cross lingual sense embedding at the source side instead of cross lingual word embedding. by giving more weight to better pseudo parallel sentence pairs in the back translation step, the quality of pseudo parallel sentences is increased. different evaluation metrics have been used to check the robustness of the model and compared with different baseline models. the experiment is performed on different morphologically rich languages english hindi, english tamil, english telegu, and one low resource endangered kangri language.

"besides word order, word choice is a key stumbling block for machine translation (mt) in morphologically rich languages due to homonyms and polysemous difficulties. on the other hand, un translated/improperly translated words are a severe issue for statistical machine translation (smt) models. the quantity of parallel training corpus has limited unsupervised smt (usmt) systems. still, current research lines have successfully trained smt systems in an unsupervised manner using monolingual data alone. however, there is still a need to enhance the translation quality of the mt output due to unaligned and improperly sensed words. this problem is addressed by incorporating unsupervised word sense disambiguation (wsd) into the decoding phase of usmt. the work provided a compendium of smt systems for five translation tasks, i.e. en indic languages for the wmt test dataset and evaluated on bleu and meteor evaluation metrics. the studies were performed on en hi, en kn, en ta, en te, and en be tasks and showed an improvement in bleu points by 2.3, 2.68, 0.78, 2.32, and 1.79, respectively, and meteor points by 1.07, 1.34, 0.72, 0.693, and 1.191, respectively, over the baseline model.

"it has been shown that the performance of neural machine translation (nmt) drops starkly in low resource conditions. thai lao is a typical low resource language pair of tiny parallel corpus, leading to suboptimal nmt performance on it. however, thai and lao have considerable similarities in linguistic morphology and have bilingual lexicon which is relatively easy to obtain. to use this feature, we first build a bilingual similarity lexicon composed of pairs of similar words. then we propose a novel nmt architecture to leverage the similarity between thai and lao. specifically, besides the prevailing sentence encoder, we introduce an extra similarity lexicon encoder into the conventional encoder decoder architecture, by which the semantic information carried by the similarity lexicon can be represented. we further provide a simple mechanism in the decoder to balance the information representations delivered from the input sentence and the similarity lexicon. our approach can fully exploit linguistic similarity carried by the similarity lexicon to improve translation quality. experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements over the state of the art transformer baseline system and previous similar works.

"the rise of intelligent systems demands good machine translation models that are less data hungry and more efficient, especially for low and extremely low resource languages with few or no data available. by integrating a linguistic feature to enhance the quality of translation, we have developed a generic neural machine translation (nmt) model for kannada tulu language pairs. the nmt model uses transformer architecture and a state of the art model for translating text from kannada to tulu and learns based on the parallel data. kannada and tulu are both low resource dravidian languages, with tulu recognised as an extremely low resource language. dravidian languages are morphologically rich and are highly agglutinative in nature and there exist only a few nmt models for kannada tulu language pairs. they exhibit poor translation scores as they fail to capture the linguistic features of the language. the proposed generic approach can benefit other low resource indic languages that have smaller parallel corpora for nmt tasks. evaluation metrics like bilingual evaluation understudy (bleu), character level f score (chrf) and word error rate (wer) are considered to obtain the improved translation scores for the linguistic feature embedded nmt model. these results hold promise for further experimentation with other low and extremely low resource language pairs.

"machine translation turns out to be an inherently complex process requiring serious attention to morphological, syntactic and semantic complexity within both the source and the target languages. most of the existing approaches to machine translation (mt) circumvent the complexity with the assumption that morphological, syntactic and semantic analysis can be done independently and sequentially. this has resulted in depriving us of the opportunity to use the language complexity to generate high quality translations. in view of this, research has been conducted to develop a multi agent systems solution for mt that uses the language complexity as an opportunity for generating a more realistic translation from english to sinhala. this multi agent solution primarily comprises a six agent swarm to deliberate on morphological, syntactic and semantic concerns of the source and the target languages without being constrained to operate in a sequential manner. these agents use the ontology of corpora and dictionary of two languages. this approach is inspired by the fact that people understand a sentence by incrementally reading through words while simultaneously considering the syntax and semantics. as such, when the system progresses in identification of words one by one, both syntactical and semantic concerns are entertained up to the current point of reading. as a result, initially decided words may be changed due to the present concern of morphology, syntax and semantics. a translation system has been implemented on the multi agent system development framework named masmt. experiments show that the multi agent solution for mt gives promising results for translating sentences of an average length and further research has been carried out to accommodate translation of long sentences.

"multilingual modelling can improve machine translation for low resource languages, partly through shared subword representations. this paper studies the role of subword segmentation in cross lingual transfer. we systematically compare the efficacy of several subword methods in promoting synergy and preventing interference across different linguistic typologies. our findings show that subword regularisation boosts synergy in multilingual modelling, whereas bpe more effectively facilitates transfer during cross lingual fine tuning. notably, our results suggest that differences in orthographic word boundary conventions (the morphological granularity of written words) may impede cross lingual transfer more significantly than linguistic unrelatedness. our study confirms that decisions around subword modelling can be key to optimising the benefits of multilingual modelling.

"accelerating global language loss, associated with elevated incidence of illicit substance use, type 2 diabetes, binge drinking, and assault, as well as sixfold higher youth suicide rates, poses a mounting challenge for minority, indigenous, refugee, colonized, and immigrant communities. in environments where intergenerational transmission is often disrupted, artificial intelligence neural machine translation systems have the potential to revitalize heritage languages and empower new speakers by allowing them to understand and be understood via instantaneous translation. yet, artificial intelligence solutions pose problems, such as prohibitive cost and output quality issues. a solution is to couple neural engines to classical, rule based ones, which empower engineers to purge loanwords and neutralize interference from dominant languages. this work describes an overhaul of the engine deployed at lemkotran.com to enable translation into and out of lemko, a severely endangered, minority lect of ukrainian genetic classificability indigenous to borderlands between poland and slovakia (where it is also referred to as rusyn). dictionary based translation modules were fitted with morphologically and syntactically informed noun, verb, and adjective generators fueled by 877 lemmata together with 708 glossary entries, and the entire system was riveted by 9,518 automatic, codification referencing, must pass quality control tests. the fruits of this labor are a 23% improvement since last publication in translation quality into english and 35% increase in quality translating from english into lemko, providing translations that outperform every google translate service by every metric, and score 396% higher than googles ukrainian service when translating into lemko.

"corpus based neural machine translation (nmt) has achieved remarkable results in many high resource language pairs and becomes widely used in recent years. however, it generates many out of vocabulary (oov) words in the low resource parallel corpus, especially for agglutinative language pairs such as javanese to indonesian translation. this paper proposes a canonical word segmentation and a linguistic feature tag to be incorporated in a transformer based nmt for translating javanese into indonesian. the word segmentation is to increase vocabulary frequency of affixed words that rarely appear, while the feature tag is to help the learning process and generates translation output. this research is conducted in two stages. first, we explore some javanese segmentation approaches using a transformer based encoder decoder to find the best segmentation model. as for the indonesian language, we use morphind to do corpus segmentation. second, we conduct experiments on nmt by applying canonical segmentation and feature tag resulted in the first stage as the input to the encoder and decoder. our experiments show that the best canonical segmentation is the one that uses character level inputs concatenated with feature tags that includes affixes and root words. it achieves an accuracy value of 84.20% of all occurrences and 56.09% of canonical segmentation. this study also reports that it reaches a f1 score of 92.78% and 96.35% for all words and canonical segmentation, respectively. as for the nmt experiments, the results show that the proposed canonical segmentation and affixes/root word feature tag applied to nmt model improves the translation performance. our best model increases the bleu score by 3.55 points compared to baseline model using words as inputs. it also increases as much as 2.57 bleu points compared to baseline model using bpe segmentation.

"morphological synthesis is one of the main components of machine translation (mt) frameworks, especially when any one or both of the source and target languages are morphologically rich. morphological synthesis is the process of combining two words or two morphemes according to the sandhi rules of the morphologically rich language. malayalam and tamil are two languages in india which are morphologically abundant as well as agglutinative. morphological synthesis of a word in these two languages is challenging basically because of the following reasons: (1) abundance in morphology; (2) complex sandhi rules; (3) the possibilty in malayalam to form words by combining words that belong to different syntactic categories (for example, noun and verb); and (4) the construction of a sentence by combining multiple words. we formulated the task of the morphological generation of nouns and verbs of malayalam and tamil as a character to character sequence tagging problem. in this article, we used deep learning architectures like recurrent neural network (rnn), long short term memory networks (lstm), gated recurrent unit (gru), and their stacked and bidirectional versions for the implementation of morphological synthesis at the character level. in addition to that, we investigated the performance of the combination of the aforementioned deep learning architectures and the conditional random field (crf) in the morphological synthesis of nouns and verbs in malayalam and tamil. we observed that the addition of crf to the bidirectional lstm/gru architecture achieved more than 99% accuracy in the morphological synthesis of malayalam and tamil nouns and verbs.

"morphology is a branch of linguistics that deals with the internal structure of words in a natural language. any word in a natural language is comprised of one or more morphemes. a morpheme is a smallest linguistic unit that forms a word. a morphological analyzer is a tool that analysis a given input word and outputs its internal structure along with its different morphemes. conversely, a morphological generator creates the possible word(s) given the morphemes. this paper presents a design of a morphological generator for an english to malayalam and english to hindi rule based machine translation system using declension rules. declensions also termed as inflections are the different variations or inflected forms of a particular word in a language. morphological generator is an essential part in the machine translation process that creates inflected words from the root word according to the morphological rules of a language. machine translation is the branch of computational linguistics that automatically translates human language to another. the language to be translated is labeled as source language (sl) and the language into which translation is done is termed as target language (tl). the declension rule based machine translation is accomplished by using grammar rules according to the word inflections of the target language. the proposed morphological generator module is elucidated with its framework and each of its modules and their working are expatiated in detail. the input and the output to/from the module are also illustrated using examples.

"luganda or ganda is a morphologically rich and low resource language from uganda. the morphological richness of luganda sentences has an impact on the quality of translation and this work looks at improving machine translation (mt) for english to luganda. luganda sentence formation bases on 10 noun classes with a prefix for singular and plural. in various aspects, the interaction of these class prefixes in sentences usually enforces different words such as nouns, verbs, adverbs and adjectives to be in agreement with the subject in a given sentence. such scenarios have resulted in various luganda word inflectional and derivational tendencies because each noun, verb, adverb or adjective finds itself having to combine with a prefix from a class it belongs and thus creating new word forms. using 6 statistical machine translation (smt) models divided equally into base and morphology models, we propose a procedure to segment luganda sentences from our english luganda parallel bible corpus. our morphological segmentation approach bases on ganda noun class (gnc) prefixes and we design a tool we call gandakit to segment luganda sentences at pre processing stage and desegement them after translation at post processing stage. in experiments, we compare translation performance of smt base models against systems trained with morphological segmentation at pre processing stage. our results show an improvement in mt performance over base models ranging by a difference of 1.58 bleu points and 0.2257 nist score for our best system.

"in natural language processing (nlp), code mixing (cm) is a challenging task, especially when the mixed languages include dialects. in southeast asian countries such as singapore, indonesia, and malaysia, hokkien mandarin is the most widespread code mixed language pair among chinese immigrants, and it is also common in taiwan. however, dialects such as hokkien often have a scarcity of resources and the lack of an official writing system, limiting the development of dialect cm research. in this paper, we propose a method to construct a hokkien mandarin cm dataset to mitigate the limitation, overcome the morphological issue under the sino tibetan language family, and offer an efficient hokkien word segmentation method through a linguistics based toolkit. furthermore, we use our proposed dataset and employ transfer learning to train the xlm (cross lingual language model) for translation tasks. to fit the code mixing scenario, we adapt xlm slightly. we found that by using linguistic knowledge, rules, and language tags, the model produces good results on cm data translation while maintaining monolingual translation quality.

"neural machine translation (nmt) is widely employed for language translation tasks because it performs better than the conventional statistical and phrase based approaches. however, nmt techniques involve challenges, such as requiring a large and clean corpus of parallel data and the inability to deal with rare words. they need to be faster for real time applications. more work needs to be done using nmt to address the challenges in translating sanskrit, one of the oldest and rich languages known to the world, with its morphological richness and limited multilingual parallel corpus. there is usually no similar data between a language pair; hence, no application exists so far that can translate sanskrit to/from other languages. this study presents an in depth analysis to address these challenges with the help of a low resource sanskrit hindi language pair. we employ a novel training corpus filtering with extended vocabulary in a zero shot transformer architecture. the structure of the sanskrit language is thoroughly investigated to justify the use of each step. furthermore, the proposed method is analyzed based on variations in sentence length and also applied to a high resource language pair in order to demonstrate its efficacy.

"the effective method to utilize monolingual data and enhance the performance of neural machine translation models is back translation. iteratively conducting back translation can further improve the performance of the translation model. in back translation where, pseudo sentence pairs are generated to train the translation systems with a reconstruction loss, but all the pseudo sentence pairs are not of good quality, which can severely impact the performance of neural machine translation systems. this paper proposes an approach to unsupervised learning for neural machine translation with weighted back translation as part of the training process, as it provides more weight to good pseudo parallel sentence pairs. the weight is calculated as the round trip semantic similarity score for each pseudo parallel sentence. we overcome the limitation of earlier lexical metric based approaches, especially in the case of morphologically rich languages. experimental results show an improvement of up to around 0.7% bleu score over the baseline paper for morphologically rich language (english hindi, english tamil, and english telugu) and 0.3% bleu score for low resource hindi kangri language.

"neural machine translation (nmt) is becoming increasingly popular as an effective method of automated language translation. however, due to a scarcity of training datasets, its effectiveness is limited when used with low resource languages, such as indian languages (ils). the lack of parallel datasets in natural language processing (nlp) makes it difficult to investigate many ils for machine translation (mt). a data augmentation approach such as backtranslation (bt) can be used to enhance the size of the training dataset. this paper presents the development of a nmt model for ils within the context of a mt system. to address the issue of data scarcity, the paper examines the effectiveness of a bt approach for ils that uses both monolingual and parallel datasets. experimental results reveal that while the bt has improved the models performance, however, it is not as significant as expected. it has also been observed that, even though the english ils and ils english models are trained on the same dataset, the ils english models perform better in all evaluation metrics. the reason for this is that ils frequently differ in sentence structure, word order, and morphological richness from english. the paper also includes error analysis for translations between languages that were utilized in experiments utilizing the multidimensional quality metrics (mqm) framework.","1.

"one of the several challenges faced by neural machine translation systems is the lack of standard parallel corpora for several language pairs. poor translation qualities often result from inadequate data. aggravating this problem further are the issues of morphological complexity and agglutination, leading to unmanageable vocabulary size, rare words and data sparsity issues. though this problem has been partly addressed by sub word algorithms such as bpe, translation systems still lag in their ability to understand sentence and word structures associated with rich morphologies. this paper aims to address these issues by employing linguistically driven sub word units into nmt systems. this approach is further enhanced by additional pos tag feature inputs. the proposed approach outperforms bpe driven machine translation models by several bleu points and is also shown to have better recall measures from evaluation by rouge metric. the results have been evaluated upon a morphologically complex dravidian language pair, kannada and telugu.

"contemporary machine translation systems prioritize fluent, natural sounding output with flexible word ordering. in contrast, interlinear translation maintains the source texts syntactic structure by aligning target language words directly beneath their source counterparts. despite its importance in classical scholarship, automated approaches to interlinear translation remain understudied. we evaluated neural interlinear translation from ancient greek to english and polish using four transformer based models: two ancient greek specialized (greta and philta) and two general purpose multilingual models (mt5 base and mt5 large). our approach introduces novel morphological embedding layers and evaluates text preprocessing and tag set selection across 144 experimental configurations using a word aligned parallel corpus of the greek new testament. results show that morphological features through dedicated embedding layers significantly enhance translation quality, improving bleu scores by 35% (44.67  60.40) for english and 38% (42.92  59.33) for polish compared to baseline models. philta achieves state of the art performance for english, while mt5 large does so for polish. notably, philta maintains stable performance using only 10% of training data. our findings challenge the assumption that modern neural architectures cannot benefit from explicit morphological annotations. while preprocessing strategies and tag set selection show minimal impact, the substantial gains from morphological embeddings demonstrate their value in low resource scenarios.","1.

"this article investigates approaches to effectively harness source side linguistic features for low resource multilingual neural machine translation (mnmt). previous works focus on using various features of a word such as lemma, part of speech tag, dependency label, and so on, to improve translation quality in a low resource scenario. however, these studies deal with bilingual translation and do not focus on using features in multilingual training setups. our work focuses on this particular point and experiments with low resource multilingual models incorporating source side linguistic features. although techniques for integrating features into an nmt model such as concatenation and feature relevance perform quite well in bilingual settings, they do not work well in multilingual settings. to remedy this, we propose the use of dummy features and language indicator features in mnmt models. experiments are conducted on english to asian language translation on a multilingual, multi parallel corpus spanning english and eight asian languages where for each language pair, the training data size does not exceed 20,000 parallel sentences. after establishing strong bilingual baselines using feature relevance mechanisms and multilingual baselines without any features, we show that our proposed dummy features and language indicator features, in combination with feature relevance mechanisms, yield significant improvements in bleu points for all language pairs. we then analyze our models from the perspectives of model sizes, the impact of individual linguistic features, validation perplexity computed during training, visualization of the activations of the relevance mechanisms, and exhaustive tuning of hyperparameters. we also report preliminary results for multilingual multi way models using linguistic features.

"nowadays, very little research for indigenous languages has been studied. indigenous languages bring significant challenges for natural language processing approaches because of multiple features such as polysynthesis, morphological complexity, dialectal variations with rich morpho phonemics, spelling with noisy data and low resource scenarios. particularly, morphological segmentation for polysynthetic languages is challenging because a word may contain many individual morphemes and training data can be extremely scarce. the current research paper focuses on inuktitut, one of the indigenous polysynthetic language spoken in northern canada. first, a rich word segmentation for inuktitut is studied using a set of rich features and by leveraging (bi )character based and word based pretrained embeddings from large scale raw corpora. second, we incorporated this pre processing step into our first neural machine translation system. our evaluations showed promising results and performance improvements in the context of low resource inuktitut english neural machine translation.

"neural approaches, which are currently state of the art in many areas, have contributed significantly to the exciting advancements in machine translation. however, neural machine translation (nmt) requires a substantial quantity and good quality parallel training data to train the best model. a large amount of training data, in turn, increases the underlying vocabulary exponentially. therefore, several proposed methods have been devised for relatively limited vocabulary due to constraints of computing resources such as system memory. encoding words as sequences of subword units for so called open vocabulary translation is an effective strategy for solving this problem. however, the conventional methods for splitting words into subwords focus on statistics based approaches that mainly conform to agglutinative languages. in these languages, the morphemes have relatively clean boundaries. these methods still need to be thoroughly investigated for their applicability to fusion languages, which is the main focus of this article. phonological and orthographic processes alter the borders of constituent morphemes of a word in fusion languages. therefore, it makes it difficult to distinguish the actual morphemes that carry syntactic or semantic information from the words surface form, the form of the word as it appears in the text. we, thus, resorted to a word segmentation method that segments words by restoring the altered morphemes. we also compared conventional and morpheme based nmt subword models. we could prove that morpheme based models outperform conventional subword models on a benchmark dataset.

"dictionaries play an important role in neural machine translation (nmt). however, a large dictionary requires a significant amount of memory, which limits the application of nmt and can cause a memory error. this limitation can be solved by segmenting each word into morphemes in parallel source corpora. therefore, this study introduces a new morphological segmentation approach for turkic languages based on the complete set of endings (cse), which reduces the vocabulary volume of the source corpora. herein, we demonstrate the proposed cse based morphological segmentation method for the kazakh, kyrgyz, and uzbek languages and present the results of computational nmt experiments for the kazakh language. the nmt experiment results show that in comparison with byte pair encoding (bpe) based segmentation, the proposed cse based segmentation increases the bilingual evaluation understudy score of 0.5 and 0.2 points on average for kazakh english and english kazakh pairs, respectively. furthermore, in comparison with the bpe based segmentation, the proposed cse based segmentation approach reduced the vocabulary size in nmt by more than a factor of two. this feature of the proposed segmentation approach will be crucial for nmt as the size of the source corpora is increased to improve translation quality.

"machine translation is the process of conversion from one language to another using computers. in spite of the existence of several traditional machine translation systems like rule based, statistical etc., the development of neural machine translation has significantly improved translation quality. however, the morphological richness and agglutinative nature of indian languages hampers the usage of neural machine translation for translation among indian languages despite its potential to overcome the difficulties posed by conventional translation systems. hence the combination of neural machine translation with morphology, part of speech tagger and word sense disambiguation is proposed to address these challenges and adapt it for bidirectional translation between sanskrit and malayalam. conventional neural machine translations are unimodal systems that utilize textual data for translation. translation quality of conventional neural machine translation is enhanced with a novel multimodal bidirectional neural machine translation system with text & speech as the two modalities based on parallel text corpus and speech database. the best performance score is obtained for two level fusion, the feature vectors extracted from speech signals using different transforms (wavelet transform, 1 d sequency mapped real transform & 1 d gcd based mapped real transform) are fused and which is further fused with a context vector from the text modality. automatic and manual review methods are employed to assess quality of translation. findings from the experiments reveal that addition of speech modality improved the overall quality of translation. bleu scores of 43.89 and 42.72 are obtained for sanskrit to malayalam and malayalam to sanskrit multimodal translation respectively.

"the uralic language group is certainly interesting  it is spotted in the very distant regions of europe and asia. spoken by about 25 million people, uralic languages have spread to both sides of the ural mountains, reaching balkans, baltic region, scandinavia, karelia, volga region, western siberia and the seaside of the arctic ocean. with the exception of the three major uralic languages (hungarian, finnish, estonian), relatively small sami and a few quite small baltic languages (veps, ingrian, livonian), all other uralic languages are spoken on the territory of the russian federation. most of them have official status in the corresponding federal regions and national autonomies. they are taught at schools, studied in universities and their usage is legally obliged in official documents. there are many enthusiasts who are trying to preserve and develop these languages. nevertheless, it is clear that russian is prevailing, so, in fact, most of small uralic languages are used mostly in colloquial speech. in terms of complexity, mt for uralic languages is a very difficult and challenging task. first, these languages have very distinct lexicon, morphology and syntax. second, there are many dialects, which are quite distinct as well. third, uralic languages have highly productive morphology which leads to a strong data sparsity in smt. fourth (and the worst), there are very few electronic documents available for most of these languages. our general approach to uralic group was as follows. we divided its languages into three subgroups: 1) with more than 1m native speakers (hungarian, finnish, estonian); 2) with 100k to 1m native speakers (udmurt, meadow mari); 3) with less than 100k native speakers (hill mari, karelian, nenets). for the major subgroup we were able to collect a sufficient amount of parallel documents from the web, and thus to build quite good baseline translation systems. automorphology and compound splitting were used to further improve translation quality. for udmurt and meadow mari, languages from the second subgroup, we managed to crawl only a modest parallel corpora and therefore were forced to rely on a hand crafted lexicon and morphology. the pipeline included the following steps: 1) used bible, wikipedia and human made dictionaries as a main lexical base; 2) developed morphological analyzers, built lemmatized models and implemented ""lemma to lemma"" decoding; 3) post processed lemmatized translations by synthesizing proper russian word forms. lack of available documents in electronic form (and sometimes even in paper form) for languages of the third subgroup poses the question of how to build translation and language models without data. in attempts to find an answer to this question, we made a little shift to a quite specific group of small languages  magic ones. some of them (like elvish dialects) have linguistic artifacts in the form of lexicon and well elaborated phonology and morphology. they are also known to be connected with uralic languages. we considered sindarin as an archetype of under resourced languages and decided first to experiment with it. some results were very promising, so we became more optimistic in upcoming efforts with mt for low resourced uralic languages and have successfully developed a translation for hill mari. copyright (c) 2008 2015 sdl plc. all rights reserved.","1.

"subword segmenters like bpe operate as a preprocessing step in neural machine translation and other (conditional) language models. they are applied to datasets before training, so translation or text generation quality relies on the quality of segmentations. we propose a departure from this paradigm, called subword segmental machine translation (ssmt). ssmt unifies subword segmentation and mt in a single trainable model. it learns to segment target sentence words while jointly learning to generate target sentences. to use ssmt during inference we propose dynamic decoding, a text generation algorithm that adapts segmentations as it generates translations. experiments across 6 translation directions show that ssmt improves chrf scores for morphologically rich agglutinative languages. gains are strongest in the very low resource scenario. ssmt also learns subwords that are closer to morphemes compared to baselines and proves more robust on a test set constructed for evaluating morphological compositional generalisation.

"action verbs are one of the frequently occurring linguistic elements in any given natural language as the speakers use them during every linguistic intercourse. however, each language expresses action verbs in its own inherently unique manner by categorization. one verb can refer to several interpretations of actions and one action can be expressed by more than one verb. the inter language and intra language variations create ambiguity for the translation of languages from the source language to target language with respect to action verbs. imagact is a corpus based ontological platform of action verbs translated from prototypic animated images explained in english and italian as meta languages. in this paper, we are presenting the issues and challenges in translating action verbs of indian languages as target and english as source language by observing the animated images. among the ten indian languages which have been annotated so far on the platform are sanskrit, hindi, urdu, odia (oriya), bengali, manipuri, tamil, assamese, magahi and marathi. out of them, manipuri belongs to the sino tibetan, tamil comes off the dravidian and the rest owe their genesis to the indo aryan language family. one of the issues is that the one word morphological english verbs are translated into most of the indian languages as verbs having more than one word form; for instance as in the case of conjunct, compound, serial verbs and so on. we are further presenting a cross lingual comparison of action verbs among indian languages. in addition, we are also dealing with the issues in disambiguating animated images by the l1 native speakers using competence based judgements and the theoretical and machine translation implications they bear.","1.

"the paper uses a hierarchical phrase based model to develop statistical machine translation (smt) systems for four low resourced south asian languages. south asian languages predominantly use traditional statistical and neural machine approaches to translate into another language (mainly english). however, translation accuracy is not much higher as south asian languages lack in necessary natural language resources and tools; hence classified as low resourced languages. any smt system needs large parallel corpora for actual performance. so, the non availability of corpora constraints the success in machine translation of those languages. another reason for poor translation quality is grammatical differences between south asian languages and english: morphological richness and different sentence structure. but traditional smt systems use the default distortion reordering model to reorder the sentences independent of their context. to overcome this problem, hierarchical phrase model translation, which uses grammar rules formed by the synchronous context free grammar, is proposed. this paper considers english to tamil, tamil to english, malayalam to english, english to malayalam, tamil to sinhala and sinhala to tamil translations. in the end, we evaluate the system using bleu as the evaluation metric. the hierarchical phrase based model shows better results compared to the traditional approach between tamil english and malayalam english pairs. for sinhala to tamil, it achieves 11.18 and 10.73 for vice versa.

"in machine translation, various tokenisers are used to segment inputs before training a model. despite tokenisation being mostly considered a solved problem for languages such as english, it is still unclear as to how effective different tokenisers are for morphologically rich languages. this study aims to explore how different approaches to tokenising maltese impact machine translation results on the english maltese language pair. we observed that the opus 100 dataset has tokenisation inconsistencies in maltese. we empirically found that training models on the original opus 100 dataset led to the generation of sentences with these issues. we therefore release an updated version of the opus 100 parallel english maltese dataset, referred to as opus 100 fix, fixing these inconsistencies in maltese by using the mlrs tokeniser. we show that after fixing the inconsistencies in the dataset, results on the fixed test set increase by 2.49 bleu points over models trained on the original opus 100. we also experimented with different tokenisers, including bpe and sentencepiece to find the ideal tokeniser and vocabulary size for our setup, which was shown to be bpe with a vocabulary size of 8, 000. finally, we train different models in both directions for the eng mlt language pair using opus 100 fix by training models from scratch as well as fine tuning other pre trained models, namely mbart 50 and nllb, where a finetuned nllb model performed best.

"amharic is the working language of ethiopia and, owing to its semitic characteristics, the language is known for its complex morphology. it is also an under resourced language, presenting significant challenges for natural language processing tasks like machine translation. the primary challenges include the scarcity of parallel data, which increases the risk of overfitting and limits the models ability to generalize effectively, and the complex morphology of amharic, which further complicates learning patterns in translation tasks. this study proposes a transformer based amharic to english neural machine translation model that leverages character level embeddings and integrates advanced regularization techniques, including dropout, l1, l2, and elastic net. by focusing on character level embeddings, the model captures the intricate morphological patterns of amharic and effectively handles out of vocabulary words. our model significantly improves upon the previous state of the art results on the amharic to english neural machine translation benchmark, achieving a bleu score of 40.59, which is 7% higher than the previous state of the art result. among the regularization techniques tested, the integration of l2 regularization with dropout applied to the pointwise feed forward network yielded the best translation performance. additionally, the proposed model significantly reduces the parameter count from 75 million to just 5.4 million, demonstrating substantial computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. extensive experiments demonstrated improvements in test accuracy, loss reduction, and translation fidelity compared to word level embedding models. this research provides valuable insights into addressing the challenges of low resource and morphologically complex languages, while also offering promising directions for future work, including the exploration of multilingual models, attention mechanism optimization, and the broader application of hybrid regularization techniques in the transformer model architecture.

"neural machine translation (nmt) is one of the approaches of machine translation (mt) that have marked its significant progress in recent years for indic languages. even though a lot of contributions have been done for many indic language pairs, there is no still such model which can be considered as a benchmark due to scarcity in rich parallel corpus, syntactic, semantic and morphological divergence across languages, difference in sentence ordering and so on. the lack of a rich parallel corpus has created a great hindrance in generating efficient nmt systems. unsupervised learning based nmt (unmt) was introduced to cater this concern as it is based on monolingual corpus. in this paper, we propose pivot based unmt model for english to kannada translation with telugu as pivot language using monolingual corpus of 1 lakh sentences for each language. to further enhance the translation quality, mbart pre trained model is used. since partial corpus is taken a conventional unmt model is built for the comparison of proposed models with state of art model. with the conventional unmt model and proposed architecture, bleu score of 0.2 and 0.5 is achieved respectively indicating that pivot based approach with telugu as pivot enhances the translation accuracy.

"in this paper we present an unsupervised method for learning a model to distinguish between ambiguous se lection of structural transfer rules in a rule based machine translation (mt) system. in rule based mt systems, transfer rules are the component responsible for converting source language morphological and syntactic structures to target language structures. these transfer rules function by matching a source language pattern of lexical items and applying a sequence of actions. there can, however, be more than one potential sequence of actions for each source language pattern. our model consists of a set of maximum entropy (or logistic regression) classifiers, one trained for each source language pattern, which select the highest probability sequence of rules for a given sequence of patterns. we perform experiments on the kazakh  turkish language pair  a low resource pair of morphologically rich languages  and compare our model to two reference mt systems, a rule based system where transfer rules are applied in a left to right longest match manner and to a state of the art system based on the neural encoder decoder architecture. our system outforms both of these reference systems in three widely used metrics for machine translation evaluation.
