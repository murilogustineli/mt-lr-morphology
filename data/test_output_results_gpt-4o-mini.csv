"""low resource languages"" usually refers to languages that lack corpora and basic tools such as part of speech taggers. but a significant number of such languages do benefit from the availability of relatively complex linguistic descriptions of phonology, morphology, and syntax, as well as dictionaries. a further category, probably the majority of the worlds languages, suffers from the lack of even these resources. in this paper, we investigate the possibility of learning the morphology of such a language by relying on its close relationship to a language with more resources. specifically, we use a transfer based approach to learn the morphology of the severely under resourced language gofa, starting with a neural morphological generator for the closely related language, wolaytta. both languages are members of the omotic family, spoken and southwestern ethiopia, and, like other omotic languages, both are morphologically complex. we first create a finite state transducer for morphological analysis and generation for wolaytta, based on relatively complete linguistic descriptions and lexicons for the language. next, we train an encoder decoder neural network on the task of morphological generation for wolaytta, using data generated by the fst. such a network takes a root and a set of grammatical features as input and generates a word form as output. we then elicit gofa translations of a small set of wolaytta words from bilingual speakers. finally, we retrain the decoder of the wolaytta network, using a small set of gofa target words that are translations of the wolaytta outputs of the original network. the evaluation shows that the transfer network performs better than a separate encoder decoder network trained on a larger set of gofa words. we conclude with implications for the learning of morphology for severely under resourced languages in regions where there are related languages with more resources.","1. Challenges of morphological complexity Answer: The abstract does not explicitly discuss the challenges posed by varying degrees of morphological complexity to machine translation systems in a low-resource language context. Evidence: There is no mention of specific challenges related to morphological complexity types such as isolating, fusional, agglutinative, or polysynthetic languages.  2. Proposed techniques Answer: The abstract describes a transfer-based approach using a neural morphological generator and a finite state transducer for morphological analysis and generation. Evidence: The abstract states, ""we investigate the possibility of learning the morphology of such a language by relying on its close relationship to a language with more resources"" and details the use of a ""neural morphological generator"" and ""finite state transducer"" for the related languages.  3. Morphology-aware techniques Answer: The abstract does not provide a direct comparison of morphology-aware techniques such as subword modeling or morphological analyzers for low-resource machine translation. Evidence: There is no mention of specific morphology-aware techniques or their effectiveness in the context of low-resource machine translation.  4. Specific findings per morphological typology (e.g., polysynthetic, agglutinative, fusional) Answer: The abstract does not provide specific findings, challenges, or proposed solutions for machine translation of languages in different morphological typologies. Evidence: The focus is on the specific case of the Gofa and Wolaytta languages, which are both described as morphologically complex but without categorizing them into typologies like polysynthetic, agglutinative, or fusional.","The abstract primarily focuses on the methodology used to learn the morphology of the Gofa language through a transfer-based approach from the Wolaytta language. It highlights the use of neural networks and finite state transducers but does not address the broader challenges of morphological complexity, specific techniques beyond those used in the study, or comparative effectiveness of morphology-aware techniques. Additionally, it lacks detailed findings related to different morphological typologies, indicating a limitation in addressing the research questions comprehensively."
"byte pair encoding (bpe) (sennrich et al., 2016) has become a standard pre processing step when building neural machine translation systems. however, it is not clear whether this is an optimal strategy in all settings. we conduct a controlled comparison of subword segmentation strategies for translating two low resource morphologically rich languages (swahili and turkish) into english. we show that segmentations based on a unigram language model (kudo, 2018) yield comparable bleu and better recall for translating rare source words than bpe.","1.

"the fast growth of communication technology has brought nations and their cultures closer together, and the demand for cross language communication has risen tremendously. there is a different learning method to connect the source language to the target language in which unsupervised learning is a blessing for low resource languages. the unsupervised machine translation is always problematic to those languages which are morphologically rich and low resources languages. morphologically rich and low resource language does not provide good results in machine translation if the translation is from morphologically less complex language to morphologically more complex languages. in this paper, we have improved the unsupervised neural machine translation by tackling the ambiguity problem and the quality of pseudo parallel sentence pairs generated through back translation for morphologically rich languages. the ambiguity problem is solved by taking the cross lingual sense embedding at the source side instead of cross lingual word embedding. by giving more weight to better pseudo parallel sentence pairs in the back translation step, the quality of pseudo parallel sentences is increased. different evaluation metrics have been used to check the robustness of the model and compared with different baseline models. the experiment is performed on different morphologically rich languages english hindi, english tamil, english telegu, and one low resource endangered kangri language.

"besides word order, word choice is a key stumbling block for machine translation (mt) in morphologically rich languages due to homonyms and polysemous difficulties. on the other hand, un translated/improperly translated words are a severe issue for statistical machine translation (smt) models. the quantity of parallel training corpus has limited unsupervised smt (usmt) systems. still, current research lines have successfully trained smt systems in an unsupervised manner using monolingual data alone. however, there is still a need to enhance the translation quality of the mt output due to unaligned and improperly sensed words. this problem is addressed by incorporating unsupervised word sense disambiguation (wsd) into the decoding phase of usmt. the work provided a compendium of smt systems for five translation tasks, i.e. en indic languages for the wmt test dataset and evaluated on bleu and meteor evaluation metrics. the studies were performed on en hi, en kn, en ta, en te, and en be tasks and showed an improvement in bleu points by 2.3, 2.68, 0.78, 2.32, and 1.79, respectively, and meteor points by 1.07, 1.34, 0.72, 0.693, and 1.191, respectively, over the baseline model.

"it has been shown that the performance of neural machine translation (nmt) drops starkly in low resource conditions. thai lao is a typical low resource language pair of tiny parallel corpus, leading to suboptimal nmt performance on it. however, thai and lao have considerable similarities in linguistic morphology and have bilingual lexicon which is relatively easy to obtain. to use this feature, we first build a bilingual similarity lexicon composed of pairs of similar words. then we propose a novel nmt architecture to leverage the similarity between thai and lao. specifically, besides the prevailing sentence encoder, we introduce an extra similarity lexicon encoder into the conventional encoder decoder architecture, by which the semantic information carried by the similarity lexicon can be represented. we further provide a simple mechanism in the decoder to balance the information representations delivered from the input sentence and the similarity lexicon. our approach can fully exploit linguistic similarity carried by the similarity lexicon to improve translation quality. experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements over the state of the art transformer baseline system and previous similar works.
