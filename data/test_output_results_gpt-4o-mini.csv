"the fast growth of communication technology has brought nations and their cultures closer together, and the demand for cross language communication has risen tremendously. there is a different learning method to connect the source language to the target language in which unsupervised learning is a blessing for low resource languages. the unsupervised machine translation is always problematic to those languages which are morphologically rich and low resources languages. morphologically rich and low resource language does not provide good results in machine translation if the translation is from morphologically less complex language to morphologically more complex languages. in this paper, we have improved the unsupervised neural machine translation by tackling the ambiguity problem and the quality of pseudo parallel sentence pairs generated through back translation for morphologically rich languages. the ambiguity problem is solved by taking the cross lingual sense embedding at the source side instead of cross lingual word embedding. by giving more weight to better pseudo parallel sentence pairs in the back translation step, the quality of pseudo parallel sentences is increased. different evaluation metrics have been used to check the robustness of the model and compared with different baseline models. the experiment is performed on different morphologically rich languages english hindi, english tamil, english telegu, and one low resource endangered kangri language.

"how can large language models (llms) process and translate endangered languages? many languages lack a large corpus to train a decent llm; therefore existing llms rarely perform well in unseen, endangered languages. on the contrary, we observe that 2000 endangered languages, though without a large corpus, have a grammar book or a dictionary. we propose lingollm, a training free approach to enable an llm to process unseen languages that hardly occur in its pre training. our key insight is to demonstrate linguistic knowledge of an unseen language in an llms prompt, including a dictionary, a grammar book, and morphologically analyzed input text. we implement lingollm on top of two models, gpt 4 and mixtral, and evaluate their performance on 5 tasks across 8 endangered or low resource languages. our results show that lingollm elevates translation capability from gpt 4s 0 to 10.5 bleu for 10 language directions. our findings demonstrate the tremendous value of linguistic knowledge in the age of llms for endangered languages. our data, code, and model generations can be found at https://github.com/leililab/lingollm.

"natural language translation is a well defined task of linguistic technology that minimizes communication gap among people of diverse linguistic backgrounds. although neural machine translation attains remarkable translational performance, it requires adequate amount of train data, which is a challenging task for low resource language pair translation. also, neural machine translation handles rare word problems, i.e., low frequency words translation at the subword level, but it shows weakness for highly inflected language translation. in this work, we have explored neural machine translation on low resource english assamese language pair with a proposed transliteration approach in the data preprocessing step. in the transliteration approach, the source language is transliterated into target language script that leverages a smaller subword vocabulary for the source target languages. moreover, the pre trained embeddings on the monolingual data of transliterated source and target languages are used in the training process. with our approach, the neural machine translation significantly improves translational performance for english to assamese and assamese to english translation and obtain state of the art results.

"machine translation (mt) systems mechanically represent a source language into a destination language while maintaining the originality of context using various natural language processing approaches. the need to assess the translation quality produced by machine translation systems has grown as a result of their increased use. however, due to their complicated morphology and syntax, other low resource languages might not always be appropriate for or applicable to the existing evaluation measures intended for english and other languages. the technique of evaluating machine translation is known as machine translation evaluation (mte). in mte, the amount of similarity and accuracy is determined by contrasting the output produced by the machine translation with the reference translation. the study assesses the metrics on several translation systems using datasets for low resource languages. the paper advances the field of machine translation (mt) by illuminating appropriate evaluation criteria for low resource languages. for this research. data from the scopus database were gathered and analyzed using the keywords machine translation and evaluation metrics from 1993 to 2023. using scopus databases, this article computes numerous application areas, documents published yearly, and keyword occurrences analysis. this work provides analysis and support for the significance of evaluation measures for different low resource languages.
