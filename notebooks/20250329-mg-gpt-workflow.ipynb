Challenges of morphological complexity   Answer: The abstract does not explicitly mention challenges related to varying degrees of morphological complexity in low-resource language contexts.   Evidence: The challenges discussed focus on polysemy, high latency, context scarcity, non-translatable entities, loanwords, ambiguous morphemes, and cross-language ambiguity, but do not specifically address morphological typologies.  2. Proposed techniques   Answer: The abstract mentions the use of domain adaptation on a simplified architecture of neural machine translation (NMT) and a classifier to determine the appropriateness of automatic translation.   Evidence: The abstract states, \"we leverage domain adaptation on a simplified architecture of neural machine translation (nmt)\" and \"the problem of query translatability is addressed by a classifier on whether the translation should be automatic or explicitly requested.\"  3. Morphology-aware techniques   Answer: The abstract does not provide specific information on morphology-aware techniques such as subword modeling or morphological analyzers.   Evidence: There is no mention of these techniques in the abstract; it primarily discusses NMT and domain adaptation.  4. Specific findings per morphological typology (e.g., polysynthetic, agglutinative, fusional)   Answer: The abstract does not provide specific findings, challenges, or proposed solutions related to different morphological typologies.   Evidence: The focus is on the challenges of machine translation in a bilingual context (Spanish and English) and the implementation of a query translation system, without reference to morphological typologies.\n",
      "The abstract primarily addresses the challenges and solutions related to machine translation in the context of bilingual queries in online shopping, specifically between Spanish and English. It highlights issues like polysemy and context scarcity but does not delve into the complexities of morphological typologies or specific techniques related to them. There is a lack of information regarding morphology-aware techniques and their effectiveness, as well as findings related to different morphological types. Overall, while the abstract provides insights into the application of NMT in a specific context, it does not fully address the research questions posed.\n"
