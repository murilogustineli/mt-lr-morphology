      "1. Challenges of morphological complexity   Answer: The abstract does not explicitly mention the challenges posed by varying degrees of morphological complexity in machine translation systems.   Evidence: The abstract discusses the context of low-resource languages and mentions \"morphologically rich and low resource languages,\" but does not detail specific challenges related to morphological complexity.  2. Proposed techniques   Answer: The abstract indicates that multilingual neural machine translation (NMT) is an active area of research aimed at improving translation quality for low-resource languages.   Evidence: The abstract states, \"to simplify the process of developing translation system for multiple languages, and to aid in improving the translation quality of zero to low resource languages, multilingual nmt became an active area of research.\"  3. Morphology-aware techniques   Answer: The abstract does not provide specific information on the effectiveness of morphology-aware techniques such as subword modeling or morphological analyzers for low-resource machine translation.   Evidence: While the abstract mentions the analysis of a multilingual NMT system for morphologically rich languages, it does not detail any specific morphology-aware techniques or their comparative effectiveness.  4. Specific findings per morphological typology (e.g., polysynthetic, agglutinative, fusional)   Answer: The abstract does not provide specific findings, challenges, or proposed solutions for machine translation of languages categorized by different morphological typologies.   Evidence: The abstract mentions testing the multilingual NMT model on Tagalog and Cebuano but does not categorize these languages or discuss findings related to specific morphological typologies.  ---\n",
