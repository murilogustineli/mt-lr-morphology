       "['1. Challenges of morphological complexity    Answer: The abstract does not explicitly discuss the challenges posed by varying degrees of morphological complexity (e.g., isolating, fusional, agglutinative, and polysynthetic languages) to machine translation systems in a low-resource language context.    Evidence: The abstract focuses on the morphological complexity of the Omotic languages Gofa and Wolaytta but does not detail specific challenges related to different morphological typologies.  2. Proposed techniques    Answer: The abstract proposes a transfer-based approach using a neural morphological generator and a finite state transducer (FST) for learning the morphology of a severely under-resourced language by leveraging a related language with more resources.    Evidence: The abstract describes creating an FST for Wolaytta and training an encoder-decoder neural network for morphological generation, which is then adapted for Gofa using bilingual data.  3. Morphology-aware techniques    Answer: The abstract mentions the use of a finite state transducer (FST) and an encoder-decoder neural network as morphology-aware techniques for morphological analysis and generation.    Evidence: The abstract details the creation of an FST for Wolaytta and the training of a neural network for morphological generation, which are both morphology-aware techniques.  4. Specific findings per morphological typology (e.g., polysynthetic, agglutinative, fusional)    Answer: The abstract does not provide specific findings, challenges, or solutions for machine translation of languages in each different morphological typology (polysynthetic, agglutinative, fusional).    Evidence: The abstract focuses on the Omotic languages Gofa and Wolaytta, which are described as morphologically complex, but it does not categorize them into specific morphological typologies or provide findings for other typologies.',\n",
       " '1. Challenges of morphological complexity    Answer: The abstract does not explicitly discuss the challenges posed by varying degrees of morphological complexity to machine translation systems in a low-resource language context.    Evidence: The abstract focuses on comparing subword segmentation strategies for two specific languages (Swahili and Turkish) without detailing the challenges related to morphological complexity.  2. Proposed techniques    Answer: The abstract mentions the use of byte pair encoding (BPE) and segmentations based on a unigram language model as techniques for subword segmentation in machine translation.    Evidence: The abstract states, \"byte pair encoding (bpe) (sennrich et al., 2016) has become a standard pre processing step\" and \"segmentations based on a unigram language model (kudo, 2018)\" as techniques used in their study.  3. Morphology-aware techniques    Answer: The abstract compares subword segmentation strategies, specifically BPE and unigram language model-based segmentations, for their effectiveness in translating low-resource languages.    Evidence: The abstract indicates that \"segmentations based on a unigram language model (kudo, 2018) yield comparable bleu and better recall for translating rare source words than bpe,\" suggesting a comparison of effectiveness between these techniques.  4. Specific findings per morphological typology (e.g., polysynthetic, agglutinative, fusional)    Answer: The abstract does not provide specific findings, challenges, or solutions for machine translation of languages in each different morphological typology.    Evidence: The abstract only mentions Swahili and Turkish, which are morphologically rich languages, but does not categorize them into specific typologies like polysynthetic, agglutinative, or fusional, nor does it provide detailed findings for each.',\n",
       " '1. Challenges of morphological complexity    Answer: The abstract highlights that unsupervised machine translation is problematic for morphologically rich and low-resource languages, particularly when translating from morphologically less complex languages to more complex ones.    Evidence: The abstract states, \"The unsupervised machine translation is always problematic to those languages which are morphologically rich and low resources languages... does not provide good results in machine translation if the translation is from morphologically less complex language to morphologically more complex languages.\"  2. Proposed techniques    Answer: The abstract proposes improving unsupervised neural machine translation by addressing the ambiguity problem using cross-lingual sense embedding and enhancing the quality of pseudo parallel sentence pairs through weighted back translation.    Evidence: The abstract mentions, \"The ambiguity problem is solved by taking the cross lingual sense embedding at the source side instead of cross lingual word embedding. By giving more weight to better pseudo parallel sentence pairs in the back translation step, the quality of pseudo parallel sentences is increased.\"  3. Morphology-aware techniques    Answer: The abstract does not explicitly mention morphology-aware techniques such as subword modeling or morphological analyzers.    Evidence: There is no specific mention of subword modeling, morphological analyzers, or similar techniques in the abstract.  4. Specific findings per morphological typology (e.g., polysynthetic, agglutinative, fusional)    Answer: The abstract does not provide specific findings, challenges, or solutions for machine translation of languages in different morphological typologies such as polysynthetic, agglutinative, or fusional.    Evidence: The abstract discusses challenges and solutions in general terms for morphologically rich languages but does not categorize them into specific morphological typologies.',\n",
       " '1. Challenges of morphological complexity    Answer: The abstract highlights challenges related to word choice in machine translation for morphologically rich languages, specifically due to homonyms and polysemous difficulties.    Evidence: The abstract states, \"besides word order, word choice is a key stumbling block for machine translation (mt) in morphologically rich languages due to homonyms and polysemous difficulties.\"  2. Proposed techniques    Answer: The abstract proposes incorporating unsupervised word sense disambiguation (WSD) into the decoding phase of unsupervised statistical machine translation (USMT) to address translation quality issues.    Evidence: The abstract mentions, \"this problem is addressed by incorporating unsupervised word sense disambiguation (wsd) into the decoding phase of usmt.\"  3. Morphology-aware techniques    Answer: The abstract does not specifically mention morphology-aware techniques such as subword modeling or morphological analyzers.    Evidence: There is no mention of specific morphology-aware techniques like subword modeling or morphological analyzers in the abstract.  4. Specific findings per morphological typology (e.g., polysynthetic, agglutinative, fusional)    Answer: The abstract does not provide specific findings, challenges, or solutions related to different morphological typologies such as polysynthetic, agglutinative, or fusional languages.    Evidence: The abstract focuses on translation tasks involving English and Indic languages but does not categorize them by morphological typology or provide specific findings for each type.',\n",
       " '1. Challenges of morphological complexity    Answer: The abstract does not explicitly discuss the challenges posed by varying degrees of morphological complexity in machine translation systems.    Evidence: The abstract focuses on the low-resource condition of the Thai-Lao language pair and the linguistic similarities between them, rather than on specific challenges related to morphological complexity.  2. Proposed techniques    Answer: The abstract proposes a novel neural machine translation (NMT) architecture that leverages a bilingual similarity lexicon to improve translation quality.    Evidence: The abstract states, \"we propose a novel nmt architecture to leverage the similarity between thai and lao,\" and describes the introduction of a \"similarity lexicon encoder\" into the conventional encoder-decoder architecture.  3. Morphology-aware techniques    Answer: The abstract does not specifically mention morphology-aware techniques such as subword modeling or morphological analyzers.    Evidence: The focus is on leveraging linguistic similarity through a bilingual similarity lexicon, rather than on specific morphology-aware techniques.  4.
